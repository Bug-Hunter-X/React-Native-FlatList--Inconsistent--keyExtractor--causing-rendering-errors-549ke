This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If the function doesn't return a unique key for each item, it can lead to unpredictable rendering behavior, including incorrect item display, extra items, and missing items.
