To fix this, ensure that your `keyExtractor` function always returns a unique, stable identifier for each item in your data array.  The best practice is to use a unique ID from your data source.  If you don't have unique IDs, you can generate them, but be mindful of performance implications for large datasets.

Here's how to implement a robust `keyExtractor`:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={yourDataArray}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()} // Use a unique ID
  renderItem={({ item }) => <YourItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

If you don't have unique IDs in your data, you can use the item index as a last resort, but this is less efficient and can lead to problems if the data array is modified:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={yourDataArray}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()} // Less efficient, use only if necessary
  renderItem={({ item }) => <YourItemComponent item={item} />}
/>
```
Remember to always prioritize using a unique, stable ID from your data source for optimal performance and predictable behavior.
